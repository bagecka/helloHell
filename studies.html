		<h1>Studies</h1>
		
			<p class="small">I recieved an Associate of Arts degree in Education in 2008 with the original intention of becoming a teacher. However, life got in the way as it often does and I ended up entering the workforce instead. I always wanted to continue learning, but I still wasn't sure what I wanted to be when I grew up. I found myself often working in or around computer labs, and I had always been entranced by technology. I ended up gravitating toward a computer science degree and began taking some classes at the community college where I work.</p>
		
		
			<p class="small">I loved it! After earning my A+ Certification, I decided to (finally) pursue my Bachelors Degree, but I needed a flexible program that would allow me to work online. Western Governors University was a perfect fit. All of my credits from the community college transferred in and I was able to use financial aid. I'm now in my seccond term, and set to graduate with my B.S. in Information Technology either spring or summer 2017, depending on how fast I work through the courses. I reccomend the program, and a colleauge at work saw my progression and is now set to begin his term in November 2015!</p>
