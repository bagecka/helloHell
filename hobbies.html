					<td><h2>Art</h2></td>
					<td class="small">
					I have always enjoyed putting my mark on things and making them my own; bringing art into every aspect of my life. I grew up, and still live, in east Texas. I admire surrealist artists and like to add an element of whimsy and surprise to my work. My speciality is in ceramic sculpture, but I also enjoy drawing, painting and working with other digital and mixed media. My work in clay has ranged from bust work to throwing ceramic pottery. My favorite subject is the human form, most notably faces. I enjoy portraiture and find pleasure in seeing a face come alive in front of me.

					<td><h2>Video Games</h2></td>
					<td class="small">
					I love video games I played in my youth. I still own and play my Super nintendo and my game boys. Right now I'm into playing games I never got to the first time they were released through emulators on my computer. Currently, I am playing Zelda: Link to the Past and Secret of Mana.

				<tr>	
					<td><h2>Crafting</h2></td>
					<td class="small">
					I love getting crafty. I learned how to crochet from my grandmother, and it's something that I really enjoy. T's fun to be able to make a scarf or hat for a friend or loved one. I also like to work with plastic canvas maiking coasters or patterns of old video game characters. It's surprisingly easy to translate 8 or 16 bit graphics into the plastic canvas. Super cute too!
